# Getting Started

## Installation

In the same location where you already have `react` and `react-dom` installed, install the `@xrpl-components/react` package using your package manager of choice, for example:

With npm:

```plaintext
npm install @xrpl-components/react
```

Or yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add @xrpl-components/react
```

## Importing from `@xrpl-components/react`

The library has a couple of entrypoints, `components` and `hooks`, which you will use to import the symbols you will need.

As you might you guess, `@xrpl-components/react/components` is the path used to import any headless components which are available, and `@xrpl-components/react/hooks` is the path used to import any hooks.

```jsx
import {
  /* ... Headless components imported here... */
} from '@xrpl-components/react/components';

import {
  /* ... Hooks imported here... */
} from '@xrpl-components/react/hooks';
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  You will not import directly from `@xrpl-components/react`, only from one of its named entrypoints.
