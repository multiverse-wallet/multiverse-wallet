# Introduction

## Basic Usage

To start developing applications that utilise Multiverse, install the `@multiverse-wallet/multiverse` package using your package manager of choice, for example:

With npm:

```
npm i @multiverse-wallet/multiverse
```

Or yarn:

```
yarn add @multiverse-wallet/multiverse
```

And then import in your project with:

```js
import multiverse from '@multiverse-wallet/multiverse';
```

The default export of the package exposes an instance of the public API. This can be used to interact with the Multiverse Wallet in order to retrieve account details and request transactions.

See the API Reference for a full list of methods and examples.
